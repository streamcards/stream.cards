Streamcards
===========

![streamcards logo](streamcards-logo-small.png)

Streamcards is a webservice that lets you build your own website using dropbox, google drive and amazon.

It's approach is to take webservices everybody already uses - and transform it into something new. You will be able to create web sites, blogs and web apps.

Streamcards follows two metaphores - the stream metaphore and the cards metaphore. Streams make continuous flow of contents accessible. Take Facebook and Twitter as example - the content is served as a never ending stream of continuous flow.

Cards on the other hand make content graspable which is otherwise hard to wrap your head around. Think of cards as a prepared, limited overview of what really matters right now. While content may change all the time, cards give you a sense of stability.

Those two concepts lie at the heart of streamcards. Further research and prototyping is on the way - expect more coming up soon. In the meantime, drop me a line if you like to contribute.

#Core concepts

Streamcards is built around two new techniques - reactive model-view binding (with Angular-JS) and web components (i.e. Polymer).

Find some of the parts that make streamcards below.

##Elements

Elements are mostly Polymer web component elements. They may be incorporated into your app as well.

sc-image [gitHub][0], [demo][1] &mdash; Provides a more elaborate img-tag with shadow

##Demo apps

I created some prototypes - and continue improving on them as well as create others at the moment. So stay tuned for more.
